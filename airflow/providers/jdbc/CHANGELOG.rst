  This release dropped support for Python 3.7

Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To configure driver parameters (driver path and driver class), you can use the following methods:

1. Supply them as constructor arguments when instantiating the hook.
2. Set the "driver_path" and/or "driver_class" parameters in the "hook_params" dictionary when creating the hook using SQL operators.
3. Set the "driver_path" and/or "driver_class" extra in the connection and correspondingly enable the "allow_driver_path_in_extra" and/or "allow_driver_class_in_extra" options in the "providers.jdbc" section of the Airflow configuration.
4. Patch the "JdbcHook.default_driver_path" and/or "JdbcHook.default_driver_class" values in the "local_settings.py" file.
